#Getting started with AMP
The following page will get you started with accelerated mobile pages (AMP). Why AMP? Because speed should be a core feature of a mobile website. Slow sites = a bad user experience and a bad user experience = a non-returning visitor. 40% of users drop off after 3 seconds.

The 3 elements of an AMP page are:
1. AMP HTML markup
2. AMP JS markup
3. Google's AMP cache

##New AMP HTML tags
1. 	```
	<!doctype html>
   	<html âš¡>
   	```
2. 	```
	<style amp-boilerplate><style> code goes here</style>
	```
3. 	```
	<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
	```

##AMP JS
Implements all the best performance practices including asynchronous javascript.


## Google Caching over HTTP 2.0
Serves the quickest possible pages by serving them off of Google's servers. Also has a built in validation system to ensure that all your markup is correct.
